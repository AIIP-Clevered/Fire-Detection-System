# Fire-Detection-System

A Fire Detection tkinter app on images is a user-friendly tool designed for identifying fire presence in images using deep learning technology. It provides a simple interface for users to upload images, and the app quickly analyzes them to determine if there's a fire. The app is trained on a comprehensive dataset of images containing both fire and non-fire scenes, allowing it to make accurate and rapid fire detection assessments.
